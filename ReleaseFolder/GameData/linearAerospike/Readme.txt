A Size 2 linear aerospike for KSP!

This engine, from the Mk-33 mod by Wild Blue Industries, is based on the Rocketdyne XRS-2200 linear aerospike engine. The XRS-2200 was developed in the mid 1990s for use with the Lockheed Martin X-33 program. The design was revolutionary in that instead of a bell-shaped nozzel, the engine had a wedge-shaped form to direct the flow of the rocket exhaust. The engine allowed part of the exhaust plume to be exposed to atmospheric pressure, which allowed efficient specific impulse throughout its flight.
